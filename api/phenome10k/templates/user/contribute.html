      <h1>Instructions for Contributors</h1>
      <p>You must sign in to access contributor options. Once you have signed in, the scans and publications pages will
         automatically update with the appropriate options. As a contributor, you can add, edit and manage 3-D image
         files
         and publications. If you are uploading images that are associated with a publication, it is often faster to add
         details of the publication first, so that it appears as an option when you add or edit an image file.</p>
      <h2>Adding Images</h2>
      <p>In order to add, edit or manage images, click on SCANS. This will produce the same view as for a
         non-contributing
         user, but with five additional links at the top ofthe page: VIEW ALL UPLOADS, VIEW MY UPLOADS, MANAGE UPLOADS,
         ADD NEW, and INSTRUCTIONS<br>
         You will only be able to manage uploads that you have added, but you can select VIEW ALL UPLOADS in order to
         conduct your own searches of the full scan library.</p>
      <p>To add a new image, click on ADD NEW.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You can either drag a stl file into the drop menu or use browse to search for the file. Images larger than
            100MB will take longer to upload and may not appear properly when loaded. It is best to reduce file sizes to
            below 100MB if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Select a minimum of one and up to six still images of different views of the stl file. This will be used as
            the image in the scan library and search, necessitating selection of at least one still. Manipulate the 3-D
            image to the desired position and then click capture. Repeat for up to six images
        </li>
        <li>Add scientific name for specimen (usually genus and species)</li>
        <li>Add additional details. Alternative names could include common names or synonyms. Location should be museum
            or
            lab where the original specimen is located. Specimen ID should identify the exact specimen in the image, as
            listed in any relevant publications.
        </li>
        <li>Assign any age or general tags that are not covered by the categories on the left side. Age tags could
            include
            more specific geologic or ontogenetic details (e.g., stage or formation). General tags should be used for
            higher-level taxonomic names other than those in the Taxonomy categories (e.g. Marsupialia, Squamata,
            Felidae). Make sure to click the + button after typing general tags to add them. If additional tags are used
            commonly, they will be added into the relevant categories in future updates to the site.
        </li>
        <li>Add any additional details of the specimen or scan to the description box, for example the specific age of a
            specimen (e.g., CT-scan of a day 35 postnatal specimen). The sample text (This is a scan of…) will disappear
            once any textis added.
        </li>
        <li>If the uploaded image contributed to a publication in a scientific journal, assignit to the relevant
            publication. Publications must have been previously addedusing the publications page. You can search among
            the
            publications that you have added or those added by others. Click the tick box to associate a publication to
            the image file. Multiple publications can be associated with an image.
        </li>
        <li>Tick any relevant boxes in the Taxonomy, Geologic Age, Elements, and Ontogenetic Age categories.</li>
        <li>Click on Confirm to save. The default is for new files to remain hidden from public view until “Publish” is
            selected by the owner or administrator under the Manage Uploads menu.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Manage Uploads</h2>
      <p>Clicking on manage uploads produces a list of files that you have uploaded. New files will be hidden by
         default.
         Clicking on “Publish” makes a file viewable by the public. Published files can be hidden by clicking on “Hide”.
         Clicking on Edit returns you to the Add New page, with all of the information populated as previously entered.
         You can change any aspect of the page other than the original stl file. To change the stl file, delete the file
         and create a new one. You can delete files via the Manage Uploads page, but this is discouraged unless there is
         an error in the image or copyright issues. Consider hiding a file rather than deleting if there is a concern
         regarding public access.</p>
      <h2>Adding New Publications</h2>
      <p>To add new publications, click on PUBLICATIONS.</p>
      <p>If you are signed in as a contributor, five links will appear, similar to those available for images: VIEW ALL
         PUBS, VIEW MY PUBS, MANAGE PUBS, ADD NEW, INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
      <p>To add a new publication, click ADD NEW. Enter title, year of publication, all authors, full journal name,
         volume, and pages, following any standard format.</p>
      <p>Paste the paper abstract into the box, and add a URL link if possible. If an open access pdf is available,
         upload
         it using the browse option. Click PUBLISH to save. This will return you to the MANAGE PUBS page, where you can
         click on PUBLISH to make publications viewable to the public.</p>
      <p>You must select PUBLISH in order for a publication to be visible in the pubs list for adding and editing
         images.
         As with images, you can hide, edit, and delete publications in the MANAGE PUBS page. You can select subsets of
         publications by year by clicking on the links on the left bar.</p>
